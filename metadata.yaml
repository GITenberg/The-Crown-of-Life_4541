description: Critics regard George Gissing as one of the most important writers of
  the Victorian era. Over the course of his career, he emerged as one of the most
  significant innovators in the literary genre of realism. In The Crown of Life, one
  of his later works, Gissing explores human relationships, and in particular, marriage,
  with the keen eye for detail and piercing insight that are his hallmarks.
